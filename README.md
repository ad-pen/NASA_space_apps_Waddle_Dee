# RM10

**Challenge:** SpaceTrash Hack: Revolutionizing Recycling on Mars  
**Date:** 4/10/2025 14:00  

---

## Objective One-Liner
Help create a waste management infrastructure for future planetary missions.

---

## Overview
RM10 is an educational 3D simulation game developed for the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025.  
Set in Jezero Crater on Mars, the game puts players in control of a rover tasked with cleaning, sorting, and recycling waste.  
Through interactive missions, puzzles, and storytelling, the game teaches middle and high school students about sustainability, biotechnology, recycling, and automation in an engaging and memorable way.

---

## Gameplay Flow
1. Explore Jezero Crater and collect waste using the rover.  
2. Sort and analyze recovered materials.  
3. Rebuild DNA for a plastic-degrading bacteria.  
4. Use the bacteria to process unrecyclable waste.  
5. Power up the **“GigaMagnet Recycler”** to clean the Martian base and close the sustainability loop.

## Educational & Scientific Impact
- **STEM Education:** Introduces sustainability, biotechnology, and recycling in an interactive, gamified environment.  
- **Real-World Relevance:** Demonstrates circular economy principles applicable to future space habitats and missions.  
- **Inspiration:** Encourages young students to think critically about waste and resource management on Earth **and beyond**.
- **Creative Demonstration of NASA-Relevant Technologies**: Introduces rover operation, bioengineering for waste digestion, and innovative recycling technologies, providing an imaginative but scientifically grounded scenario for future Mars habitats.

## Missions

### Mission 1
The rover identifies and collects waste scattered across Jezero Crater, sorting materials into recyclable, bioprocessable, and unusable categories — exactly as future crews would.  
Waste examples include:  
- Air cushions recycled into polyethylene  
- Polymer matrix composites recycled into thermoplastic resin and carbon fiber  
- Drink pouches (CapriSun-type) recycled into multiple useful materials  

### Mission 2
Players repair the DNA of a plastic-eating bacteria by pairing bases correctly — learning the concept of biological recycling.  
By solving DNA repair puzzles, players understand how DNA bases complement each other.  
The mission ends with a maze challenge to reinforce the learning process through gameplay.

### Mission 3
This section of the game aims to bridge the gap between Learning & other-worldy creativity in which the player reaches the end of their journey to power our "Magnet" (Endgame mechanic). The player finally makes it to the Jeraza Crater, the goal was to relive all the moments the player just experienced in an AIO experience at the very end!
